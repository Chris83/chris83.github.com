    <p>In modern development, and in particular with web frameworks such as Rails that offer and encourage extensive use of database ORM libraries, some developers skip learning SQL in favour of using ORMs. It is as if developers think they no longer need to know SQL when they've got an ORM. The truth is that we are not this fortunate. You should *only* use an ORM if you know exactly what it is generated by the ORM and you are sure that the generated SQL is as well performing as what you could have written by hand.</p>
