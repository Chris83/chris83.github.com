# Things I gotta do (and possibly document)

* Do something cool with Redis
* Blog about how to learn Ruby for absolute beginners based on experience from people I've put into the langugae
* Learn more about evented I/O, and perhaps write something that does it in order to understand how it works
    - Learn something about sockets too meanwhile
    - I gotta make something cool in Node too then, seems like that's the new hello world for cool kids
