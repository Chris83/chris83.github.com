title: Things I gotta do
updated: 17 Oct, 2010

Here's a page that will grow more than it will shrink. It describes what I want to do. Why, and maybe even how. I'll cross out things as we go. This'll be fun.

> Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.

Quotes are nice, they make you sound smart. (Like semicolons)

# Unix

I want to learn more about Unix. How does it work, and what were those nutheads thinking over 30 years ago when they started solving problems?

I want to understand `epoll(2)`, `fork(2)`, `select(2)` sockets, all the mighty protocols, and I don't know what not. I want to understand how all these parts and layers play together.  
How it all follows the all mighty Unix philosophies:

> Make each program do one thing well.

> Small is beautiful.

> Think parallel.

In conclusion:

> Less is more

I want to write something in Ruby that truly shows I've learned this.

When I've learned Unix; I can code C too. **Bonus**.

# Technology

I like technology. I like new stuff. I discover new ones daily, and I choose out some that I want to play with. Some more than others. Here's a list.

## Ruby

I love Ruby. I want to learn more about Ruby. And I want to spread my knowledge.

**Beginners Guide**

Write guide on how to get from absolutele programming beginner, to Ruby pro based on own experience.

## Redis

Redis is web scale. I like web scale.

## Unicorn

Truly beautiful. But how do you scale this to multiple servers?

Thought:

* Request
* Nginx reverse proxy
* Varnish (content if cache?)
* HAProxy (load balancing)
* Unicorn server puts request into Unix socket, and lets a worker pick it up

## Doxie

I want [a Doxie scanner](http://getdoxie.com/). I don't want papers anymore. I always throw the papers somewhere far away.

# Misc

## Bookmarks

I need to share my bookmarks in a smart way. Uuh, maybe I could use fancy technologies to do it?

## Evul plans

I have them, too.

### IE5

It has returned.

{% highlight bash %}
$ google-chrome --user-agent="Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Windows NT;)"
{% endhighlight %}
