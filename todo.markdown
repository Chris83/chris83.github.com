# Unix

I want to learn more about Unix. How does it work, and what were those nutheads thinking over 30 years ago when they started solving these problems?

I want to understand `epoll(2)`, `fork(2)`, `select(2)` sockets, all the mighty protocols, and I don't know what not. I want to understand how all these parts come into play with each other. How it all follows the all mighty Unix philosophies:

> Make each program do one thing well.

> Small is beautiful.

> Think parallel.

In conclusion:

> Less is more

I want to write something in Ruby that truly shows I've learned this.

When I've learned Unix; I can code C too. **Bonus**.

# Technologies

I like technology. I like new stuff. Here are some I'd like to play with.

## Ruby

I love Ruby. I want to learn more about Ruby. And I want to spread my knowledge.

### Guide

Write guide on how to get from absolutele programming beginner, to Ruby pro based on own experience.


## Redis

Redis is web scale. I like web scale.

## Unicorn

Truly beautiful. But how do you scale this to multiple servers?

Thought:

1. Request
2. Nginx reverse proxy
3. Varnish (content if cache?)
4. HAProxy (load balancing)
5. Unicorn server puts request into Unix socket, and lets a worker pick it up

# Misc

## Bookmarks

I need to share my bookmarks in a smart way. Uuh, maybe I could use fancy technologies to do it?
