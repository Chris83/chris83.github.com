updated: 14 Oct, 2010

List of things I gotta do. Basically just to have a collection of things I can eventually cross out.

* Do something cool with Redis
* Blog about how to learn Ruby for absolute beginners based on experience from people I've put into the langugae
* Learn more about evented I/O, and perhaps write something that does it in order to understand how it works
    - Learn something about sockets too meanwhile
    - I gotta make something cool in Node too then, seems like that's the new hello world for cool kids
* Organize my bookmarks somewhere nice and start sharing, e.g. Delicious
* Create a script to add stuff here
