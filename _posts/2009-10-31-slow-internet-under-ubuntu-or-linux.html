title: Slow internet under Ubuntu/Linux
---

<p>In both Ubuntu Jaunty and Ubuntu Karmic I've had trouble with the internet, actually also when I was running Fedora. It was unstable, I could go to sites, but it took a good while to look up the host (according to Chrome). It had periods where it was good, usually short ones, and periods where it sucked like hell, and was almost unusable. Download speed, and everything else than the browser, seemed to work normally though. At first, I thought I had Ipv6 troubles, but this seemed to not solve my problem. At some point, randomly, I decided to switch to OpenDNS, since I had been using it before, on other platforms, and I noticed it made those a bit faster, so it was worth the try!</p>

<p>And<strong> it worked.</strong> It worked really good. A lot of people might face this problem too, and I advise them to try out OpenDNS, and see if that fixes their problem. :)</p>

<p><a href="https://store.opendns.com/setup/device/ubuntu/">Here's a guide</a> from OpenDNS on how to set up OpenDNS on your Linux machine!</p>

<p>Good luck. :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit: </strong>As of Ubuntu Karmic, it seemed that the OpenDNS thing didn't solve it properly, therefore <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/67921/slow-website-loading-on-ubuntu-karmic">I asked for help at SuperUser</a>, if you still have the problem after switching DNS, I advice you to <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/67921/slow-website-loading-on-ubuntu-karmic">go there</a> and read the answers to my question.</p>
