      Updated my flamingo and dog house sprites. Still putting off doing the picnic table, even though its the last obstruction I have to update. I just don’t know how to draw it in the ¾ perspective and still have it take up the same amount of space. I have also added two chat bubbles for then a mom catches a kid. The chat bubble for the moms has a picture of broccoli on it. The chat bubble for the kids has a sad face with some tears streaming down the cheeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also added in a garbage collector to store kids that are caught and moms that are no longer patrolling. The garbage gets cleaned up at the start of a new game and the moms go back on patrol. I had a small problem at first where the moms would also get destroyed at the start of a new game. It turned out I added them to the garbage when they found a kid for some reason.

     It didn’t feel like I got much done today, mostly because I’m slow with art. I have improved since starting this jam, even if it’s only a little bit. My small picture of broccoli looks like broccoli to me. That is an accomplishment!

    <p>
      Only two more days and there is still so much more I want to do with this game. I want to have the characters actually turn and face the direction they move. I want to convert the mom’s detection from a radius to a frontal cone. I still have to calculate and display the score when a player wins. I want to display the number of steps taken by the play win or lose. I would really like to randomly generate the yards and number of moms per yard and their patrols.
