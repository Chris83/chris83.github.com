      I switched the game up a bit. The moms now move after each kids uses up all of their moves. This made the game easier, the second yard is still a challenge though.

      I got my roommates to play voice actors for my game along with myself as the fat kid. So each kid and the moms now have voices. You only get to hear them though if a mom catches a kid. Everyone has three different things to say. There is a censored F-bomb and damn is used a couple times in the voices so be warned!

     Programming a sound manager was fun and much easier than I thought it would be. It worked great on my first try. I have also learned that I prefer to edit sounds than images. I used <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> to record and edit the sound bites. The microphone was just my gaming headset.

      <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0BxZZUhRd2Bv9VDZlTmd0ZHVXME0/Build.0.1.1.html">Here</a> is the newest version if you're interested in trying it out. Tomorrow my goals are to add a graphic for the mom when she catches a kid. I am also changing it so once a mom does catch a kid she stops patrolling. Then you could sacrifice a buddy to get past a mom! I also want to update the flamingo and dog house art.
