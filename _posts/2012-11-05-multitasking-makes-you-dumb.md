title: Multitasking makes you dumb
---

As part of researching for my 30 days of super productiviy, I have explored
the topics of context switching and multitasking. I found that multitasking has
a tremendous effect on how we approach tasks and too much multitasking can
actually alter how our brain processes information in a negative way.

Multitasking is attempting to handle more than one task at a time. The human
mind is not directly capable of this, thus it emulates multitasking by
rapidly alternating between the tasks. This makes for a higher rate of errors
due to lack of attention, and since context switching from one task to another
is expensive, the sum of time spent on the tasks is larger than if the tasks
were done sequentially. (Think green threads with a huge context switch cost
with lots of deadlocks and race conditions.) [^4]

Furthermore, our brain excercises something Dr. Meyer of the University of
Michigan calls "adaptive executive control" where our brain assigns priorities
to the tasks we are performing in parallel.[^3] For instance, when driving and
talking in cell phone, our brain assigns a higher priority to responding to our
the phone conversation than focusing on the road, resulting in a worse response
time than drivers intoxicated over the 0.08% legal limit. [^5]

Multitaskers are unable to devote all their focus into one task, thus their work is
worth less and consumes more time.

Stanford professors gussed before a study that people who frequently
multitask must be excellent in filtering important elements of a series of
tasks: [^1]

> In one experiment, the groups were shown sets of two red rectangles alone or

> the second frame were in a different position than in the first frame.

> They were told to ignore the blue rectangles, and the low multitaskers had no
> problem doing that. But the high multitaskers were constantly distracted by the
> irrelevant blue images. Their performance was horrible.

Desperately they attempted to find tasks in which the frequent multitaskers
performed better, such as short term memory and context switching, but
multitaskers failed to show any improvement in any task the Stanford
psychologists presented. They are worse at paying attention and are easily
distracted. They have their mind in a myriad of different places at the same
time, not effectively processing any information.

One last theory was that the multitaskers could be faster at context switching,
performing this all the time, but even here they were siginificantly worse:

> The test subjects were shown images of letters and numbers at the same time and

> they had to determine if the digits were even or odd. When told to concentrate
> on letters, they had to say whether they were vowels or consonants.

> Again, the heavy multitaskers underperformed the light multitaskers.

> "They couldn't help thinking about the task they weren't doing," Ophir said.
> "The high multitaskers are always drawing from all the information in front of
> them. They can't keep things separate in their minds."

Effectively, multitaskers train themselves to superficially consume
multiple sources of input from memory of the external world. Their ability to
filter relevance to their current goal declines, because multitaskers are
distracted by highly irrelevant information. Multitaskers actually become worse at
multitasking, by multitasking. [^2]

Multitasker students report to have more problems in their academic work.
Students who browse Facebook and instant messaging while doing
homework, perform worse in school. [^6] In 1999, 16% of media was combined, in 2005
26% of media was used together. This number must have skyrocketed since, with
Generation Z and Y being its victims. [^7]
