My own projects and projects I've contributed to, and if you're lucky: A little history.

# Projects

## [ticketmaster][tm]

ticketmaster is a Gem which eases communication with various project and ticket management systems by providing a consistent Ruby API.

ticketmaster let's you "remap" a system into the consistent ticketmaster API, easily. For instance the description of an issue/ticket, might be named description in one system, and problem-description somewhere else. Via ticketmaster, this would always be called description. The ticketmaster remaps makes it easy for you to integrate different kinds of ticket systems, into your own system. You don't have to take care of all the different kinds of systems, and their different APIs. ticketmaster handles all this for you, so you can focus on making your application awesome.

## [Flimpl][fl]

When I started programming *again* summer 2009, I started with PHP because that was what I already knew. I started a project and started hacking it together in PHP, but when I had written around 1000 lines of code I realized how much I could now turn better, and started again from scratch.

This happened three times before I realized I had to do something about it. So I started looking into frameworks. I just had one problem with frameworks, because I'm such a curious cat: I had no idea how they worked. So I set to create my own simple PHP framework in order to learn how they worked.

This all turned out much more interesting than I originally thought it would be. I learned a lot about MVC, frameworks in general and design patterns. I found these "more advanced" (at least compared to what I was used to) sides of programming more challenging, and I find challenges fun.

When I set to write a script that would generate controllers, models and so on I decided I wanted to write it in something like Python. I came to like Python. This is where I moved from PHP. 

And somehow at the end I ended up writing it in Ruby, and came to love that language, but that's a whole other story..

## Flying Cat

A modular, Lua-based operating system project I started with [Charlie Sommerville][cs].

Even though we kinda hit a block on this one, we learned *a lot*, and we loved our idea. Maybe someday we'll return to this. I surely hope so, was a lot of fun.

## [can has lolcat?][chl]

Fetches a random lolcat, and returns the appropriate output format.

Made for [Whyday 2010](http://whyday.or).

## [Anyhub Ruby Gem][arg]

Ruby API for [Anyhub][ah].

Slightly outdated nowadays, since it's from before Anyhub had an api.

## [Mongui][mg]

Mongui is an extremely simple HTTP GUI for Mongo, created with Sinatra.

## [Gists][gists]

I have a lot.
